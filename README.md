# wafflepod
Wafflepod is an Android App that allows the user to write comments to every existing track/podcast on Spotify.

## General Idea and Motivation behind the Project
Wafflepod is an Android App that allows the user to write comments to every existing track/podcast on Spotify. The tweak is that each track/podcast is split into multiple subsections. Comments only appear within the section, they have been added to. Therefore, there is a more direct link between a comment and a specific part of the track/podcast. 

I decided to write this app because I am missing this direct feedback feature in Spotify. In addition to that, I wanted to learn Kotlin.
